            <p>
            Highly motivated recent graduate with a Bachelor of Computer Science from Augusta University and an Associate's in Science from Fayetteville Technical Community College.
             Eager to kickstart a career in technology, I bring a versatile skill set and a passion for learning to any project or team.
              Proficient in a wide range of programming languages and technologies, including Python, Ruby-on-Rails, Svelte/SvelteKit, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, Java, C++, and SQL.
               Demonstrated expertise in computer systems design, highlighted by projects such as creating a model using Scikit Learn's Support Vector Classifier to detect broken bones in medical X-rays with 97% accuracy, and building a miniature model of a building with Arduino microprocessors controlling various components.
                Committed to excellence and ready to begin my career in the field of computer science and technology.
